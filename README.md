# Postgres_Task
Here I created a virtual environment. I installed pandas,psycopg2,psycopg2-binary in the virtual environment & connected Postgres with the python and create Database from VScode.Exract the data from csv file with pandas and insert that data in the database created before. Then I plot the deaths and confirmed death in histogram. Lastly emailed that file to the Trainer.
